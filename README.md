# Gaming-Room
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wants to provide a web application game called Draw It or Lose It which splits players into teams. Each team has 30 seconds to guess a picture as it is slowly loaded onto their screen, if they fail to  guess the "thing" in the allotted time, the next team has 15 seconds to make a guess. Points are awarded to the team that guesses the image correctly. 

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe that I did well in putting the software design template together. With it, we should be able to pitch our recommendations well to The Gaming Room. Additionally, as part of the software design template, we created a UML diagram to give a visual to the code that would be created for the game, which I did well with.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It was a methological approach to formulating a plan or the company. By putting all of the companies requirements down, both parties are able to review and agree/ammend portions that they see fit. 

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The Executive Summary. Upon completion of the rest of the document, I would ensure that the executive summary is in line with the rest of the document, and laid out the actions that The Gaming Room could expect. 

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The Gaming Room wanted to create a cross platform game to broaden its consumer base. In order to accomplish this task, we developed a plan of action to describe the steps that need be taken to have the project come to fruition, as well as listed out the system requirements, and recommendations to which OS would work best during gaming construction.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

First, we need to have a complete understanding of what the customer wants as their end-goal. Working with the customer, we can establish the plan of action to accomplish that goal. I liked the layout of the design template, and would consider its use in the future.
